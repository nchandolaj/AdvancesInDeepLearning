# Advances In Deep Learning: My Learning Journey

I am graduate student studying Artificial Intelligence.

This repository documents my structured progression through advances in Deep Learning concepts and projects. It serves as a central hub to track milestones, manage curriculum planning, and ensure consistent skill development.

## Methodology
* **AI-Assisted Workflow:** This is an AI-first learning initiative. I leverage Gemini as a technical co-pilot to accelerate curriculum planning, audit code quality, and assist with debugging.
* **Instructional Documentation:** I adopt the "Feynman Technique" for documentation. Notes and code comments are written in an instructional style, designed to explain the topic clearly as if being presented in an online course.
* **References:** While I utilize a broad range of data sources (official docs, Books, StackOverflow, blogs, etc.), specific references are cited only when a source was critical to a unique implementation or logic.

## Curriculum Roadmap

The learning path / curriculum is structured into four distinct phases moving from theoretical primitives to state-of-the-art application. Phases can be viewed as an Agile "Epics", each containing "User Stories".

### Phase 1: Advanced Training

### Phase 2: Generative Models

### Phase 3: Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Phase 4: Computer Vision

### Warp Speed
Catch all for all things new in deep learning in 2026.

### Hardware
Provide insights into hardware details/knowledge supporting the deep learning topic. 

### Models
Popular Deep Learning Models
