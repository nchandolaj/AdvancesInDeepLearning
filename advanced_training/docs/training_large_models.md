# Training Large Models

Machine Learning models started evolving with the advancements in the hardware (GPUs) that they used.

## History

* Pre 2012:
  - Small CPUs only (Intel Core i3/i5), convex optimization, limited performance.
  - Limited to Convex optimization.
* 2012-2018:
  - Single GPU models (GTX 1080), non-convex optimizers, better architectures
* 2019-2022:
  - Multi-GPU models, multi-dataset models
